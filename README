Introduction

This is a C program which lists all the devices found on the machine
and from that you can select which interface needs to be monitored.
Also you can filter out the packet depending on the type (ip,tcp,.etc).
The filtered packets will be dumped to a file which is given by the 
user.

------------------
compiling the code
------------------
gcc -lpcap sniff.c -o sniffer

-------------------
executing the code

./sniffer ip dump.pcap

ip - filter expression
dump.pcap - The file to which packets have to be saved
